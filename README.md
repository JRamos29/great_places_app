# Great Places (Flutter App)

### This is a small and simple Flutter app to save images with their locations using native device features like <b>Camera, Maps and Location</b>. The app use [Provider/ChangeNotifier](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) for state management, and also includes features such as:

- Image picker from camera with [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker);
- Access and save image to device storage with [path](https://pub.dev/packages/path) and [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider);
- Persisting data in a local SQL database with [sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite);
- Access Google Maps with [google_maps_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter);
- Fetching data from [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) using the [Http package](https://pub.dev/packages/http);
- Defined ENV variables across Flutter/Android/iOS with [flutter_config](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_config) package;

#

<b>Note:</b> The purpose of this app is to explore native functionalities from Dart/Flutter as from third-party packages as well. So the UI it's not as fancy as a final product for a real app.
